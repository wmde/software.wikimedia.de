                    <p>
                        You can volunteer as a developer, editor, data donor, partner or community supporter. Everyone has special skills and the Wikimedia movement is good place to be given complete expression. The biggest question is: What do you want to do?

                    <h2>Internships</h2>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For us your personal development is paramount. We are helping you to identify your strengths and find your own project at Wikimedia. We offer internships, working student contracts, dissertations for pupils and students. Each pupil and student gets a
                        mentor who supports them with their personal development.
                    </p>

                    <p>We can support you in several ways:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Level I: mandatory and voluntary internships (3-6 months)</li>
                        <li>Level II: dissertation (6 months)</li>
                        <li>Level III: Working Student (1-2 years)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Additionally we support you and your project by offering you the possibility to go to hackathons and events to present your project.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                    <p>
                        We do not only support individual development but also the advancement of a study group. If you have a semester project at your university, we welcome to work with the group closely.
