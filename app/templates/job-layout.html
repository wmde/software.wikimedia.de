                <strong>Wikimedia Deutschland – Gesellschaft zur Förderung Freien Wissens e. V.</strong> is a non-profit organisation based in Berlin, Germany.
                With more than 100 employees and about 65.000 members, it is the oldest and largest of 37 independent chapters of
                the international Wikimedia movement. The best-known Wikimedia project, the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia, is used
                by millions of people across the world every day and is continuously updated and improved by millions of users.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wikimedia Deutschland furthers these ideals even beyond the free encyclopedia: It is our aim to establish and promote the
                creation, collection, and distribution of free knowledge in all parts of society. Our objective is to create a world in which
                the sum of all human knowledge is freely accessible for everyone. The main focus of our activities is the support of volunteers,
                the development of technology and software, and the cooperation with cultural and scientific institutions. Furthermore, we
                advocate on both the national and EU-level a legal framework which allows for free knowledge to become part of our everyday life.
